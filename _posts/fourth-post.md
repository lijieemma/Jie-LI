Hanshi Festival
---

As one of the 24 solar terms, Qingming Festival is set to honour ancestors, which usually occurs from April 4th to 6th. After festival, temperature rises up and rainfall increases, demonstrating that it is the high time for spring ploughing and sowing. 

Hanshi Festival is the day before Qingming, when there will be no fire to cook and only cold food will be served. It is said that this festival is in memory of Jie Zidui, who was a senior state official in feudal China's Spring and Autumn Period. His lord was Jin’s prince Chong Er. After an imperial flight, Chong Er was compelled to escape to other states with his followers, during which they were fed up the suffering. One day, knowing that Chong Er was starving and dying, Jie Zidui cut his own flesh from his leg and boiled it for his lord. After all these hardship and sufferings, Chong Er successfully restored the state of Jin, but left behind Jie’s saving of his life. Since then, Jie Zidui decided to live in seclusion with his mother.

Once Chong Er realized that he had made a huge mistake, he went to search for Jie Zidui in person. He had the hills set on fire because of the dense forests and lack of signs, trying to persuade Jie to come back. But Jie Zidui never showed up. Someone found that Jie Zidui and his mother were died in an embrace, leaving a letter written his blood. It read: I cut my flesh to show my loyalty, wishing my lord to be sober and bright. In memory of Jie Zidui, Chong Er ordered that fire could not be lit and only cold food were available on the day of Jie’s death.

Nowadays, the tradition of no fire had no longer been in existence, while other traditions of willows planting, ancestors worship and tomb sweeping have been passed so far. During Qingming, people will sweep tombs to show respects to the ancestors with their family.
