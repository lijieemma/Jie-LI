Comparative political economy

---
Economic theorizing was not at all giving a unanimous and positive assessment: the theory of optimal monetary zones (Mundel, 1961) was stressing that this voluntarist move ran against adverse structural conditions such as limited labor mobility and price and wage rigidities. But the rationality of expectations of governments and economic actors (the Euro is irreversible) was supposed to induce them to make all the required structural reforms in terms of public finance, industrial and innovation policy, labor flexibility and mobility. This was a confusion between the logic of power and economic rationality. Some dissenting economists stressed the dysfunctionality of the euro with respect to the diversity of régulation modes but at that time they found few allies in civil society (Boyer, 1999).

经济理论化并未给出一个一致且明确的评估，最优货币理论（Mundel, 1961）强调这种唯意志论举动的存在是针对不利的结构性条件，比如：劳动力流动受限、价格受限以及工资刚性受限等。但是，政府和经济参与者预期的合理性（欧元体系是不可逆转的）理应引导他们做出所有规定的结构性改革，这些改革涉及到公共财政、工业创新政策以及劳动力灵活性和流动性。显然，大国逻辑与经济合理性之间是存在矛盾的。一些持反对意见的经济学家强调欧元体系在调节模式中的多样性方面显现出了异常，但是，他们的意见无法得到人们的认同。

Economic interests of the various economic sectors and social groups did not converged at all: the European multinationals were strong proponents of the Euro and highly skilled professionals could extend their horizons and economic gains. Surveys showed that low skilled workers, welfare dependents and small and medium sized firms were conscious that they would probably be losers of the single currency. The rhetoric of a general bettering of welfare was not believed by a large fraction of public opinion (remember the No to the Maastricht treaty in France and Netherland) but the capacity of influence of the potential winners was overwhelming. And they could invoke that leading economists were supporting Euro creation.

各种经济领域和社会团体的经济效益并不是趋于一致的，欧洲跨国企业是欧元体系中的强有力的组成部分，高技能专业人才可以开阔视野并且增加经济收益。调查显示，低技术水平的工人，福利依赖者以及中小型企业已经意识到他们可能是单一货币政策的受损者。普及改善福利体系的虚夸言辞并不能使公众信服。但是，潜在受益者的影响力是势不可挡的。他们可以借助“知名经济学家支持欧元体系的建立”这一说法来加以证明。

The national political authorities are the decision makers of last resort and de facto the logic of power had the determinant role in the launching of the Euro. The risk of breaking down of the Single Market under recurrent exchange rates crises was real and the political costs would be heavy. Many weak currency economy governments hoped to recover at the European level part of monetary sovereignty, previously lost given the primacy of the Deutschmark. From a geopolitical standpoint it was crucial to hook reunified Germany to Western Europe. Federalists imagined that the Euro would favor a multipolar international financial regime and replace the Bretton Woods system. These political motives have been determinant and the fusion of the Ost-mark and Deutschmark had already shown that a monetary integration is decided for political and symbolic reasons whatever the large economic and social costs to be incurred.

国家政治权威机构是最终的决策者，实际上，大国的思想逻辑对欧元体系的推行有决定性作用。在欧洲汇率机制危机下，打破单一市场的风险是真实存在的，并且政治成本是沉重的。大多采用疲软货币经济政策的国家都希望能在欧洲重新获得部分货币主权，在此之前，德国的货币马克退出历史舞台被欧元取代。从地缘政治的角度来看，将重新统一的德国与西欧联系起来是十分重要的。联邦派认为欧元体系有助于多极化的国际金融体制，取代布雷顿森林体系（Bretton Woods system）。这些政治动机一直以来都是决定性因素，东德和西德货币的统一已经表明了，无论需要承担多大的经济和社会成本，货币一体化的实现依靠的是政治性和象征性因素。
