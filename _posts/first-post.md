> The tendon of the triceps surae, the muscles attached to the rear part of the calcaneus, and are responsible for the final push-off by the back leg in an attack or which absorb the force of the body in a retreat, is named after Achilles.

>小腿三头肌的肌腱被称为阿基里斯腱，即脚跟尾部的肌肉，在进攻时，它负责为小腿发力，并在小腿后撤时抵消后挫力。

>Because of the stresses that are centered in this area by the physicality of fencing, especially in the back leg, medical problems and injuries related to the Achilles tendon can be the downfall of even the most superior fencer.

>由于在击剑的过程中，力量主要集中在小腿上，所以，即使是最优秀的击剑运动员，也难以避免跟腱的损伤。

>To understand how these injuries develop it is necessary to have an idea about the anatomy and mechanics of the triceps surae. As mentioned above, because the Achilles tendon attaches to the rear of the heel, behind the axis of the ankle, when the triceps surae contract the foot moves into plantar flexion (points down; for example, to stand on your toes or complete a lunge).

> 在了解这些损伤是怎样造成的之前，我们需要了解小腿三头肌的解剖学和力学原理。如上所述, 因为跟腱连接的是脚后跟, 在脚踝后面。 当三头肌收缩，足底就会移动到跖屈位置 (踮起脚，例如, 踮起脚跟，重心在脚趾上或做一个弓箭步的时候)。

>Plantar flexion also prevents you from falling over when retreating because it provides a stable base to step back on to. The other important feature of the anatomy of the triceps surae is that the two muscles it is made of, the gastrocnemius and the soleus, have different points of attachment in the leg.

>足底跖屈还会在你后撤时提供了一个稳定的基底，防止你摔倒。在解剖学分析上，三头肌,是由两种肌肉组成的，即腓肠肌和独角肌, 在腿上有不同的着力点。这是三头肌的一个重要特征.
