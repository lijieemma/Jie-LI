Climate Change

---

>EARTH is smouldering. From Seattle to Siberia this summer, flames have consumed swathes of the northern hemisphere. One of 18 wildfires sweeping through California, among the worst in the state’s history, is generating such heat that it created its own weather. Fires that raged through a coastal area near Athens in late July killed 91. Elsewhere people are suffocating in the heat. Roughly 125 have died in Japan as the result of a heatwave that pushed temperatures in Tokyo above 40°C for the first time.

>地球正在慢慢闷烧着。这个夏天，从西雅图到西伯利亚，北半球的大片土地都被大火所吞噬。18场山火席卷了加利福尼亚州，其中堪称当地历史上最严重的山火之一，释放的能量甚至改变了局部的天气系统。7月底，在雅典附近沿海地区肆虐的火灾造成了91人死亡。在其他地方，人们也因酷热的天气而备受煎熬。日本遭受热浪的侵袭，首都东京的气温首次上升至历史最高温度40℃，全国因此丧生的人数约有125人。

>Such calamities, once considered freakish, are now commonplace. Scientists have long cautioned that, as the planet warms—it is roughly 1°C hotter today than before the industrial age's first furnaces were lit—weather patterns will go berserk. An early analysis has found that this sweltering European summer would have been less than half as likely were it not for human-induced global warming.

>这种以往被视为反常灾害的事件如今却已是是司空见惯。很早之前，科学家们就警告称，随着地球的变暖（相较于工业时代第一批熔炉点火以前的气温，目前全球的平均气温已上升了约1℃），气候模式将发生翻天覆地的变化。早前一项分析表明，如果不是人为导致全球变暖，今年欧洲夏日的温度也不至于如此闷热。

>Yet as the impact of climate change becomes more evident, so too does the scale of the challenge ahead. Three years after countries vowed in Paris to keep warming “well below” 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, greenhouse-gas emissions are up again. So are investments in oil and gas. In 2017, for the first time in four years, demand for coal rose. Subsidies for renewables, such as wind and solar power, are dwindling in many places and investment has stalled; climate-friendly nuclear power is expensive and unpopular. It is tempting to think these are temporary setbacks and that mankind, with its instinct for self-preservation, will muddle through to a victory over global warming. In fact, it is losing the war.

>然而，随着气候变化的影响变得更加明显，未来的挑战势必是更加艰难。三年前，各国在法国巴黎约定要将全球平均气温相较于工业化前水平的升温控制在低于2℃的范围内，而如今温室气体的排放量却再次上升。对石油和天然气的投资也在增加。2017年，煤炭需求量四年以来首次出现增长。许多地方正在逐步减少对风能和太阳能等可再生能源的补贴，对这些方面的投资也陷入了停滞；对气候变化有利的核电造价不仅昂贵，而且因其弊端不受民众欢迎。人们往往会认为这些挑战只是暂时性的挫折，不论发生什么事情，最终都能凭借自己维持生存的本能，战胜全球变暖的战役。而事实上，人类正在输掉这场战役。
